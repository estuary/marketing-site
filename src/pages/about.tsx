                            We didn't start at trying to make real-time data
                            flows more accessible by abstracting away the
                            low-level work… it is just what happened.

                            Our team researched streaming frameworks while
                            working with billions of daily events, and
                            ultimately realized that we'd have to build our own

                            ) to have a scalable distributed streaming framework
                            that is built with kappa architectures in mind,
                            required less continuous resource management, and
                            could unify both our batch and real-time pipelines.
