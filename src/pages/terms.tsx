        </p>

          11. <span className="privacy-bold privacy-underline">BINDING ARBITRATION</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event of a dispute arising between you and Estuary under or relating to these Terms of Use or the
          Website (each, a “<span className="privacy-underline">Dispute</span>”), such dispute will be finally and
          exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“
          <span className="privacy-underline">FAA</span>). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and
          binding on the other party. NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A
          JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT
          SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND
          DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral
          arbitrator selected jointly by you and Estuary, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of
          appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current
          Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules,
          or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’
          rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website www.jamsadr.com. Each of you and Estuary will be
          responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules.
          Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not
          preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate
          jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or
          online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside.
          The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to
          confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate
          in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information
          (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the
          arbitration. As set forth in <span className="privacy-underline">Section 13</span> below, nothing in these
          Terms of Use will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as
          necessary to protect our proprietary interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          12. <span className="privacy-bold privacy-underline">CLASS ACTION WAIVER</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually.
          To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii)
          there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to
          utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
          purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY
          BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
          PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
        </p>

        <p>
          13. <span className="privacy-bold privacy-underline">EQUITABLE RELIEF</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our intellectual property
          rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore
          be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement. We may, without waiving any other remedies under
          this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive
          relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced
          above. All claims or disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be heard exclusively
          by any of the federal or state courts of competent jurisdiction located in the State of New York.
        </p>

        <p>
          14. <span className="privacy-bold privacy-underline">RESTRICTIONS</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Website is available only to individuals aged 13 years or older. If you are 13 or older, but under the age
          of majority in your jurisdiction, you should review the Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure
          that you and your parent or guardian understand it. If you are under the age of 13, you may use the Website
          only with the consent of your parent or guardian. We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion,
          to deny you access to the Website, or any portion of the Website, without notice and without reason.
        </p>

        <p>
          15. <span className="privacy-bold privacy-underline">MISCELLANEOUS</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that
          provision or any other provision in this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective against us unless made in
          writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance. Except as
          expressly agreed by us and you in writing, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between you and us
          with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written
          or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. The section headings are provided merely for
          convenience and shall not be given any legal import. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of our
          successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.
