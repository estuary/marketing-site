                <p className="privacy-underline privacy-bold">THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</p>
                <p>In the course of operating the Services, Estuary collects or receives the following types of information from you, which may include personal information.</p>

                <p className="privacy-bold">Contact Information</p>
                <p>We collect contact information through our Services; contact information typically includes your name, email address, and any information you provide in messages to us. We use such contact information for purposes such as providing you with information about the Services, responding to your inquiries, sending you email alerts (including marketing emails), registering you as an Authorized User of the Product, and providing you the Services.</p>

                <p className="privacy-bold">Payment Information</p>
                <p>If you purchase the Product, to process your payment you will be required to provide to us certain billing information, which may include providing a credit card number, expiration date, bank account information, billing address, activation code, and similar information (collectively, “<span className="privacy-underline">Payment Information</span>”). You authorize our third-party payment vendors including, without limitation, Stripe, to collect, process, and store such Payment Information in accordance with their respective privacy policies. We reserve the right to change our payment vendors at any time, or to use additional payment vendors, at our discretion, and will update this Privacy Policy from time to time accordingly. By purchasing the Product, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s terms and conditions and privacy policy, which are available at https://stripe.com/legal and https://stripe.com/us/privacy, respectively.</p>

                <p className="privacy-bold">Activity Information</p>
                <p>We will have access to any Customer Content that you submit to us for our portability services. Customer content includes: (i) the data that Customer, or its Client, as applicable, requests Estuary to transfer from one system to another, (ii) configuration information to connect to the relevant systems, such as passwords and user identifications, and (iii) other information provided to Estuary to help configure how and when the data transfer will occur, such as notification preferences. We only access and use the Customer Content to provide you the data portability services.</p>

                <p className="privacy-bold">Server Log Information</p>
                <p>Our servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of such access, including the device’s IP address, user agent string (e.g., operating system and browser type/version), and the pages you’ve clicked on while on our Services, and details regarding your activity on the Services such as time spent on the Services and other similar data with respect to how you use the Services. We may use these log files for purposes such as assisting in monitoring and troubleshooting errors and incidents, analyzing traffic, or optimizing the user experience.</p>

                <p className="privacy-bold">Cookies</p>
                <p>We may collect information using “cookie” and other similar technologies. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive (or other storage medium) so that your computer will “remember” information about your use. We use both first and third party session cookies and persistent cookies. Below is a general primer on session and persistent cookies; information collected by cookies depends on its particular purpose. For more information, please see the information regarding analytics providers discussed further below.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span className="privacy-bold">Session Cookies:</span> We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Services. A session ID cookie expires when you close the Services.</li>
                    <li><span className="privacy-bold">Persistent Cookies:</span> A persistent cookie remains on your device for an extended period of time or until you delete them. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our visitors to personalize the experience on our Services. Also, to the extent we provide a log-in portal or related feature on our Services, persistent cookies can be used to store your passwords so that you don’t have to enter it more than once.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you do not want us to place a cookie on your device, you may be able to turn that feature off on your device. Please consult your browser’s documentation for information on how to do this and how to delete persistent cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from us, certain aspects of the Services may not function properly or as intended.</p>

                <p className="privacy-bold">Third-Party Analytics Providers</p>
                <p>We use one or more third–party analytics services to evaluate your use of the Services, as the case may be, by compiling reports on activity (based on their collection of IP addresses, Internet service provider, browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, data and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Services you visit, number of links clicked, search terms and other similar data with respect to how you use the Services) and analyzing performance metrics. These third parties use cookies and other technologies to help collect, analyze, and provide us reports or other data.</p>

This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and business partners.

                <ul>
                    <li>Like many businesses, we hire other companies to perform certain business-related services. We may disclose personal information to certain types of third party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information and their functions are: hosting services, technical assistance, database management/back-up services, usage analytics, email marketing platforms, customer service, collaboration services, authentication services, and authorization services.</li>
                    <li>To provide our Services and administer promotional programs, we may share your personal information with our third-party promotional and marketing partners, including, without limitation, businesses participating in our various programs.</li>
                    <li>We may, from time to time, share and/or license personal information to other companies who may provide you information about the products and services they or their partners offer. However, to the extent required by law, you will be given the opportunity to opt out of such sharing.</li>
                    <li>We may share personal information and Customer Content with third party systems in connection with the Services and to enable use of the Product, such as when you use the Product to move data to or from one system to another.</li>
                    <li>We may also disclose personal information to our parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, joint ventures, or other companies under common control to support the marketing and sale of our products and services.</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="privacy-bold">Business Transfers</p>
                <p>In the event of a merger, dissolution, reorganization or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal information, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This policy shall be binding upon Estuary and its legal successors in interest.</p>

                <p className="privacy-bold">Disclosure to Public Authorities</p>
                <p>We are required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.</p>

                <p className="privacy-underline privacy-bold">OPT-OUT FOR DIRECT MARKETING; EMAIL MANAGEMENT</p>
                <p>You may opt out at any time from the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes by emailing the instructions to <a href="mailto:privacy@estuary.dev">privacy@estuary.dev</a> or by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of any Estuary marketing email and following the instructions found on the page to which the link takes you.

                <p>Estuary takes very seriously the security and privacy of the personal information that it collects pursuant to this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, we implement reasonable security measures designed to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases or the databases of the third parties with which we may share your information (as permitted herein), nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to us may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.</p>

                <p className="privacy-underline privacy-bold">CHILDREN</p>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through the Services. If you are under 13, please do not give us any personal information. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide personal information without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@estuary.dev">privacy@estuary.dev</a>, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
