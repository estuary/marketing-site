Using log-based Change Data Capture (CDC), Flow continuously ingests new and updated records without heavy bulk loads. Whether you need low-latency replication, hybrid cloud integration, or continuous analytics, Estuary Flow ensures your data is accurate, fresh, and always moving where it needs to go.`;

    const defaultDestDescription = `The ${destConnector.title} materialization connector in Estuary Flow delivers data from your pipelines directly into your destination system â€” continuously and in real time. Using merge-based writes, Flow efficiently updates only changed records, ensuring your destination stays perfectly in sync without unnecessary reprocessing. Whether for analytics, AI, or operational use cases, Estuary Flow provides a reliable, cost-efficient way to keep ${destConnector.title} up to date.`;
